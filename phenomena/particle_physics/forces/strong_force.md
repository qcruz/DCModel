# Phenomenon: The Strong Nuclear Force

## One-Sentence Synthesis

## Observation

The strong force binds quarks into hadrons and is the strongest force at nuclear scales.
It has two striking properties not shared by electromagnetism:

**Confinement:** Quarks cannot be separated. Attempting to pull a quark away from a
hadron requires energy that grows linearly with distance (~1 GeV/fm string tension).
Before the quarks separate, enough energy has been deposited to create a new quark-
antiquark pair — the string "breaks" and new hadrons form. Isolated color charge has
never been observed.

**Asymptotic freedom:** At very short distances (high energies), the coupling weakens.
Quarks inside a proton behave nearly as free particles at the scale probed by high-energy
scattering. The coupling α_s(μ) runs with energy scale μ:

```
α_s(M_Z) ≈ 0.118    [at Z-boson mass ~91 GeV]
α_s(1 GeV) ≈ 0.5    [at 1 GeV — strong coupling is strong]
α_s → 0             [as μ → ∞]
α_s → ∞             [as μ → Λ_QCD ≈ 200 MeV — confinement scale]
```

## Standard Explanation

Quantum chromodynamics (QCD): SU(3) non-Abelian gauge theory. Eight gluons carry
the force; each gluon carries a color-anticolor charge combination. Because gluons
self-interact (cubic and quartic terms in the Lagrangian), the field lines between
separated quarks do not spread out (as in EM) but collapse into a narrow flux tube.
The tube has constant energy per unit length → linear potential → confinement.

Asymptotic freedom (Gross, Politzer, Wilczek 1973, Nobel 2004): the beta function
of QCD is negative, meaning the coupling decreases at shorter distances. This is the
opposite of QED and is a unique property of non-Abelian gauge theories with few enough
matter fields.

Confinement has been verified numerically on the lattice but has never been analytically
proven. The Clay Mathematics Institute lists "Yang-Mills existence and mass gap" as one
of the seven Millennium Prize Problems.

## Dimensional Folding Explanation

### The Same Logic as Electromagnetism, at D7

The strong force arises by the identical mechanism as electromagnetism — local gauge
symmetry arising from independent closure events — but at depth D7 instead of D5:

- At D5: local U(1) phase symmetry → requires 1 connection field A_μ → electromagnetism
- At D7: local SU(3) color symmetry → requires 8 connection fields G_μ^a → strong force

The D7 SU(3) closure gives each quark a **color orientation** — a direction in the
3-dimensional color space (red, green, or blue). Just as the fold orientation θ is
independently defined at each point for D5, the color orientation is independently
defined at each point for D7. This local SU(3) symmetry structure produces 8 gluon fields
G_μ^a (a = 1,...,8) as the connection on the color bundle.

Eight gluons because SU(3) has 8 generators (3² − 1 = 8) — one connection field
per generator.

### Why SU(3) Is Different: Non-Abelian Self-Coupling

This is where the strong force departs radically from electromagnetism.

For U(1) (electromagnetism): the phase θ is a number. Two phase rotations commute:
```
e^{iα} × e^{iβ} = e^{i(α+β)} = e^{iβ} × e^{iα}
```
The order doesn't matter. Photons carry no electric charge and do not attract each other.

For SU(3) (strong force): the color orientation is a 3×3 matrix. Two color rotations
do **not** commute in general:
```
U₁ × U₂ ≠ U₂ × U₁     [for non-Abelian group elements]
```

The non-commutativity means that the parallel transport of a color orientation around
a closed loop depends on the path taken — not just the endpoints. This produces a
field strength that includes a self-coupling term:

```
F_μν^a = ∂_μ G_ν^a − ∂_ν G_μ^a + g_s f^{abc} G_μ^b G_ν^c
```

The last term (f^{abc} G_μ^b G_ν^c) has no analogue in EM. The f^{abc} are the
SU(3) structure constants — they encode the non-commutativity. This term means:

**Gluons carry color charge.** A gluon is not neutral under its own force (unlike photons
in EM). Each gluon carries a color-anticolor combination (e.g. red-antiblue). Gluons can
interact with other gluons through 3-gluon and 4-gluon vertices.

### Why Self-Interaction Causes Confinement

In electromagnetism, field lines between two charges spread outward in all directions.
The field energy decreases as 1/r → the force falls as 1/r².

In QCD, gluon self-attraction causes the field lines to pull each other in. Instead of
spreading, they collapse into a narrow **flux tube** — a tube of color field connecting
two quarks with approximately constant cross-section.

```
Energy of flux tube = σ × L     [string tension σ ≈ 1 GeV/fm, L = separation]
Force = dE/dL = σ ≈ constant    [does not fall with distance]
```

This is the linear confinement potential V(r) = σr. The energy grows without bound as
the quarks are separated, so they can never be free.

At a distance r ~ 1/Λ_QCD ≈ 1 fm, enough energy has accumulated (~1 GeV) to create a
new quark-antiquark pair. The string "breaks" and two new hadrons form. Color remains
confined throughout.

**In DFC terms:** the D7 SU(3) closure topology does not support isolated color-charged
configurations in the D3 localization layer. A lone D7 winding cannot propagate through
D3 space without a compensating anti-winding nearby. The compression field has no stable
isolated-color solution — any attempt to create one either pulls the compensating closure
along (confinement) or creates a new closure to compensate (pair creation).

*The precise DFC mechanism for why isolated D7 winding is forbidden is an open problem
requiring the full nonlinear compression field theory at D7. The statement is consistent
with the model but not yet formally derived.*

### Why Self-Interaction Causes Asymptotic Freedom

The running coupling constant α_s(μ) evolves with energy scale μ. The rate of change
is given by the beta function β(α_s):

```
μ dα_s/dμ = β(α_s) = −(b₀/(2π)) α_s² + O(α_s³)
```

For SU(3) with N_f quark flavors:
```
b₀ = 11 − (2/3)N_f
```

For N_f ≤ 16 (and in our universe N_f = 6): b₀ > 0, so β < 0. The coupling decreases
as μ increases (shorter distances).

**Why is b₀ positive?** Two competing contributions:

| Contribution | Sign | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Gluon self-coupling | +11 (per gluon loop) | Non-Abelian self-interaction: gluons carry color and self-interact; their contribution to the beta function is opposite in sign to EM (anti-screening) |
| Quark loops | −2/3 per flavor | Quark-antiquark pairs partially screen color (same as EM) |

In EM, only screening occurs (electron loops reduce the apparent charge at low energy →
coupling increases at high energy). In QCD, the gluon self-coupling provides
**anti-screening** that dominates → coupling decreases at high energy.

**In DFC terms:** at short distances (high energy), the D7 closure topology is being
probed at scales smaller than the characteristic closure size ~1/Λ_QCD. At these scales
the coupling is the "bare" D7 closure coupling before the self-interaction effects of
the gluon field have had space to build up. At long distances, accumulated gluon self-
coupling amplifies the effective charge — this is the origin of confinement.

The transition between these regimes occurs at Λ_QCD ~ 200 MeV, the scale at which
α_s becomes O(1) and the perturbative expansion breaks down.

## Formal Equations

### QCD Lagrangian

The full strong-force Lagrangian (gluon kinetic + quark coupling):

```
L_QCD = −(1/4) F_μν^a F^{aμν} + Σ_f q̄_f (iγ^μ D_μ − m_f) q_f
```

where:
```
F_μν^a = ∂_μ G_ν^a − ∂_ν G_μ^a + g_s f^{abc} G_μ^b G_ν^c   [field strength]
D_μ = ∂_μ − ig_s T^a G_μ^a                                    [covariant derivative]
T^a = λ^a/2                                                    [SU(3) generators, λ^a = Gell-Mann matrices]
f^{abc}                                                         [SU(3) structure constants: [T^a,T^b] = if^{abc}T^c]
```

This is exactly the Maxwell Lagrangian extended with:
1. 8 fields instead of 1 (one per SU(3) generator)
2. The self-coupling term f^{abc}G_μ^bG_ν^c in F_μν

### Running Coupling

The coupling constant at scale μ relative to scale μ₀:
```
α_s(μ) = α_s(μ₀) / [1 + (b₀ α_s(μ₀)/2π) ln(μ/μ₀)]

where b₀ = 11 − (2/3)N_f = 11 − 4 = 7    [for N_f = 6 active flavors at high energy]
```

At μ = M_Z = 91.2 GeV:  α_s ≈ 0.118  (measured)
At μ = 1 GeV:            α_s ≈ 0.5   (strong coupling is truly strong)
At μ → Λ_QCD:            α_s → ∞     (perturbation theory breaks down — confinement)

### Confinement: Linear Potential

At separations r ≫ 1/Λ_QCD, lattice QCD shows the quark-antiquark potential:
```
V(r) = −(4/3)(α_s/r) + σr     [Coulomb term + linear confinement term]
```

String tension: σ ≈ 0.18 GeV² ≈ 0.9 GeV/fm

At short range r ≪ 1/Λ_QCD: the Coulomb term dominates (as expected from asymptotic
freedom — quarks nearly free). At long range: the linear term dominates — confinement.

### Color Neutrality Requirement

A color-neutral state satisfies:
```
T^a |hadron⟩ = 0     for all a = 1,...,8
```

i.e., the state is in the singlet representation of SU(3). For three quarks (baryon):
```
|color singlet⟩ = ε_{rgb} |r⟩|g⟩|b⟩ / √6     [antisymmetric in color]
```

For quark-antiquark (meson):
```
|color singlet⟩ = δ_{c c̄} |c⟩|c̄⟩ / √3     [color-anticolor]
```

In DFC: color neutrality is the requirement of zero net D7 winding number in the D3
localization layer. Three quarks with one unit each of red, green, and blue winding
cancel to zero net D7 winding. One quark with one unit of red winding and one antiquark
with one unit of anti-red winding also cancel to zero.

Note: The α_s(M_Z) gap is RESOLVED (Cycle 144). Root cause of the old 8.1% error was using the
wrong M_c(D7): the α₁∩α₃ RG crossing (~8×10¹⁴ GeV) is not the DFC closure condition. The correct
condition is α₃(M_c(D7)) = α_common = 2/(27π) (ECCC), which gives M_c(D7) = 1.566×10¹⁵ GeV and
α_s(M_Z) = 0.11821 (+0.006%) via ECCC self-consistency (Direction B: ECCC + SM α_em(0) input).
The Λ_QCD forward-running formula (using α_s(M_c(D7)) = α_common as the UV initial condition)
gives 45.9 MeV (−83%), which reflects incomplete threshold matching, not the α_s gap.

## Open Questions

1. **Yang-Mills mass gap — DFC five-sub-problem construction (PRIMARY FOCUS, Cycles 178–199):**

   The three-layer structural argument (T3, Cycle 178) has been developed into a five-sub-problem
   Clay Prize construction in `ISSUES.md` T14. Current status:

   Key T1 structural inputs: E_BPS=113.1 M_Pl>0; Q_top=2 exact; I₄=C₂(fund,SU(3))=4/3 exact.
   4D gap bound: Δ_4D ≥ 2√2×Λ_QCD = 861 MeV [T3, SP2]. **Clay Prize progress: ~72%, CPC: ~50%.**
   Remaining gap: SP2 R1 intermediate domain [3.0,17.1] volume-uniform bound (T3→T2a); SP5 M_c(D7) from V(φ) (T2b→T2a).
   Full tracking: `foundations/yang_mills_clay.md`.

2. **Derive Λ_QCD from DFC parameters (SP5, T2a):** The confinement scale Λ_QCD is set by
   dimensional transmutation. The old one-loop formula (Cycle 133, `equations/confinement.py`)
   gave 45.9 MeV (−83% vs PDG) — this was a one-loop artifact from using b₀=7 (N_f=6) at
   low energy, corrected in Cycle 159. Current status:
   - **Two-loop α_s route (T3):** Starting from α_s(M_Z)=0.11821 (ECCC, C144), two-loop RGE
     running gives Λ_QCD=304.5 MeV, within the PDG range 210–340 MeV.
   - **V(φ) dimensional transmutation chain (T3, SP5):** V(φ)→β→g_eff²→α_common→M_c(D7)→Λ_QCD.
     Two-loop Landau pole gives 685 MeV [T3]; factor-2 scheme dependence (Landau pole ≠ Λ_MS).
   - **Remaining T4:** Derive M_c(D7) from V(φ) substrate dynamics without using α_s(M_Z) as
     input. Once M_c(D7) is derived from first principles, Λ_QCD follows from the 2-loop RGE.
   See `equations/ym_dimensional_transmutation.py` (Cycle 188), `equations/rho_meson_dfc.py`.

3. **RESOLVED (Cycle 144): α_s(M_Z) = 0.11821 (+0.006%, Tier 2a).** The resolution came
   from Direction B of the ECCC self-consistency: given SM α_em(0) as input and the ECCC
   structural identity (the scale ratio M_c(D7)/M_c(D5) tracks 1/α_em(0)), the strong
   coupling is determined: α_s(M_Z) = 0.11821 (observed 0.11820, +0.006%). See
   `equations/alpha_em_selfconsistency.py`. **Remaining open:** derive α_s independently
   from D7 geometry without using α_em(0) as a cross-input — i.e., derive M_c(D7) from
   V(φ) parameters alone. This is the SU(3) analogue of the fine structure constant
   derivation from D5 geometry.

4. **Non-perturbative D7 dynamics:** The entire confinement regime (r > 1 fm,
   α_s > 1) is beyond perturbation theory. In DFC, this is the fully nonlinear
   compression field at D7 — the same regime where the Schrödinger/KG approximations
   break down. A complete DFC account of confinement, hadron masses, and nuclear binding
   requires the nonlinear D7 field theory, which is the largest open technical problem
   in the model's particle physics sector.
