## The Remaining Condition in the Tsirelson Proof

The Tsirelson bound proof in `foundations/tsirelson_bound.md` requires two properties:

1. **Binary observables:** A_i² = B_j² = I  (eigenvalues ±1 only)
2. **SU(2) commutation:** ‖[A_i, A_j]‖_op ≤ 2

Property 2 is established by the SU(2) Lie algebra of the D6 closure.

Property 1 requires that **each measurement produces exactly one of two outcomes (±1)**.
This is not a free postulate — it must follow from the structure of the D6 kink.

This document derives Property 1 from the φ⁴ field topology.

## The φ⁴ Field Configuration Space

The DFC substrate satisfies the potential:

```
V(φ) = −α/2 φ² + β/4 φ⁴
```

with stable minima at φ₀ = ±√(α/β).

The **finite-energy field configurations** are all field configurations φ: ℝ → ℝ
such that the total energy is finite:

```
E[φ] = ∫ dx [½(∂φ/∂x)² + V(φ)] < ∞
```

### Boundary Conditions at Spatial Infinity

For the energy integral to converge, the field must approach one of the stable
minima at both spatial boundaries:

```
φ(x → −∞) = ±√(α/β)
φ(x → +∞) = ±√(α/β)
```

This gives four combinations of boundary conditions:

| φ(−∞) | φ(+∞) | Sector | Name |
|---|---|---|---|
| +φ₀ | +φ₀ | trivial (+) | vacuum |
| −φ₀ | −φ₀ | trivial (−) | vacuum |
| −φ₀ | +φ₀ | topological +1 | kink |
| +φ₀ | −φ₀ | topological −1 | antikink |

### Connected Components = Topological Sectors

Two configurations are **topologically equivalent** if one can be continuously
deformed into the other (while keeping the energy finite). Continuous deformation
cannot change the boundary values at spatial infinity.

Therefore, the finite-energy configuration space splits into **exactly four** connected
components — one per row in the table above.

**However:** The two vacuum sectors (+φ₀, +φ₀) and (−φ₀, −φ₀) are related by
the global Z₂ symmetry φ → −φ of the potential. Under this symmetry, these two
sectors map onto each other. In the DFC context, the absolute sign of φ₀ is not
a physical observable — what matters is the **relative** orientation of the field
across the kink.

The physically distinct sectors are therefore:

| Winding number N | Physical sector |
|---|---|
| N = 0 | No kink (field is uniform) |
| N = +1 | Kink (field crosses from −φ₀ to +φ₀) |
| N = −1 | Antikink (field crosses from +φ₀ to −φ₀) |

The winding number is a **topological invariant** — it cannot be changed by any
smooth, finite-energy deformation.

## Why There Are Exactly Two Measurement Outcomes

A D6 kink precursor is a localized, nearly-above-threshold fluctuation of the
substrate field. Before measurement, it is a superposition of incipient kink and
antikink configurations — the field amplitude is near zero (the unstable saddle
of V(φ)) in some localized region.

A **measurement event** (see `foundations/measurement.md`) is an interaction that
pushes the local field amplitude above the buckling threshold. Once this threshold
is crossed:

1. The field nucleates into one of the two stable minima at the interaction site
2. The nucleation is irreversible — the resulting configuration is topologically
   protected (kink or antikink, not both)
3. The topological sector is permanently fixed: the field can no longer return to
   the saddle configuration at finite energy cost

**This is why measurement outcomes are binary.** Not because of a postulate, but
because the φ⁴ field has exactly two stable minima, and once the threshold is crossed,
the field nucleates into exactly one of them.

The mathematical statement:

```
π₀(M_fin.energy) = Z₂    [disconnected into two topological sectors]
```

where π₀ is the zeroth homotopy group (connected components) of the space of
finite-energy configurations with nontrivial winding.

## The Instability Analysis: Why No Continuous Distribution

A natural objection: why can't the field nucleate into a continuous distribution
of values between +φ₀ and −φ₀? Why only ±φ₀?

The potential V(φ) has **only two stable points** (φ = ±√(α/β)). Any field
configuration at an intermediate value is unstable — V'(φ) ≠ 0 and the field
is driven toward one of the stable minima.

More precisely, the Hessian of the energy functional:

```
δ²E/δφ(x)² = −V''(φ) = α − 3βφ²
```

is **negative** at φ = 0 (the saddle):

```
δ²E/δφ(x)²|_{φ=0} = α > 0 ???

NO — wait, in the potential V = −α/2 φ² + β/4 φ⁴:
V'(φ)  = −αφ + βφ³
V''(φ) = −α + 3βφ²

At φ = 0: V''(0) = −α < 0   [unstable — saddle point]
At φ = φ₀: V''(φ₀) = −α + 3βφ₀² = −α + 3α = 2α > 0   [stable minimum]
```

At the saddle φ = 0, the field has **one unstable mode**: the mode that grows
exponentially toward ±φ₀. There is no stable intermediate configuration. The
field dynamics force a binary choice.

**Nucleation dynamics near the saddle:**

```
∂φ/∂t ≈ α φ    [from linearized equation near φ=0]
→ φ(t) ∼ φ_fluctuation × exp(√α × t)
```

Any small fluctuation δφ ≠ 0 at the saddle grows exponentially until it reaches
±φ₀. The sign of the initial fluctuation δφ determines which minimum is reached.
There are no other attractors.

**This is the origin of binary outcomes:** The φ⁴ potential has a one-dimensional
unstable manifold at the saddle, and that manifold connects to exactly two attractors.

## Connection to Spin-½ and D6 SU(2)

The D6 closure has SU(2) topology. The two-sector structure (N = ±1 winding) maps
onto the two spinor components of SU(2):

```
N = +1 kink  ↔  spin up   |↑⟩
N = −1 kink  ↔  spin down |↓⟩
```

This is the Jackiw-Rebbi correspondence (see `foundations/spin_emergence.md`):
the zero-mode of the Dirac equation in the background of a kink is localized on
the kink and carries half-integer quantum numbers. The two-sector structure of the
φ⁴ kink produces exactly the two-component Hilbert space required for SU(2) spinors.

The binary measurement outcomes are therefore a direct consequence of:
1. D6 closure → φ⁴ substrate at D6 depth
2. φ⁴ substrate → two topological sectors (N = ±1)
3. Two sectors → binary measurement outcomes ±1
4. Binary outcomes + SU(2) → Tsirelson bound (see `foundations/tsirelson_bound.md`)

This closes the logical chain from the D6 substrate structure to the Tsirelson bound.

## Nucleation Rate and the Born Rule

The nucleation into the N = +1 or N = −1 sector is **not deterministic** — it
depends on the pre-measurement field configuration (the quantum state).

The **nucleation rate** at a given location x depends on the local field amplitude
squared:

```
Γ(x) ∝ |φ(x)|²   [rate of threshold crossing at x]
```

For a kink precursor in a superposition:

```
φ(x) = c₊ φ₊(x) + c₋ φ₋(x)
```

where φ₊, φ₋ are the incipient kink and antikink profiles, the local amplitude
squared is |φ(x)|² = |c₊|²|φ₊(x)|² + |c₋|²|φ₋(x)|² + cross terms.

**The Born rule connection (structural, not yet derived):**

If the nucleation probability for outcome N = +1 equals |c₊|², then we have
the Born rule: P(outcome) = |amplitude|².

The structural argument: the field nucleates where its amplitude is largest. A
pure N = +1 configuration nucleates with certainty into the kink sector. A pure
N = −1 configuration nucleates with certainty into the antikink sector. A
superposition nucleates into each sector with probability proportional to the
relative amplitude squared — assuming the nucleation statistics are determined
by the local field energy density.

**Formal derivation status:** This argument is physically plausible but not yet
a rigorous theorem. A complete derivation would:

1. Compute the first-passage time distribution for threshold crossing in the
   φ⁴ field as a function of |φ(x)|²
2. Show that the probability of reaching the N = +1 sector first is exactly |c₊|²
3. This would complete the Born rule derivation from DFC substrate dynamics

## Quantitative Checks

The key quantities that must be consistent:

### 1. Kink energy gap

The energy cost to move between N = +1 and N = −1 sectors requires passing through
the saddle at N = 0. The barrier height:

```
ΔV = V(0) − V(φ₀) = 0 − (−α²/4β) = α²/(4β)
```

For β ≈ 0.035 and α calibrated at D6:
```
NOTE (Cycle 48 correction): The BPS-correct E_kink = (4/3) c² φ₀²/λ differs
from the previously used formula by a factor of 2√β. The correct ratio is:

ΔV/E_kink = [α²/(4β)] / [(4/3) c α^(3/2)/(β√2)]
           = 3√2 α^(1/2) / 16
           ∝ √α   [depends on α; evaluated at α=1 for natural-unit comparison]
```

For α = 1, β = 0.035: ΔV/E_kink ≈ 3√2/16 ≈ 0.265
(Previous value 0.71 was computed with the wrong E_kink formula.)

The barrier is about 26.5% of the kink energy — the topological sectors are
well-separated. Thermal fluctuations can overcome the barrier only at T comparable
to the kink energy scale. At any observable temperature T << E_kink, the sectors
are completely stable and nucleation between them is thermally suppressed.

### 2. Unstable mode growth rate

Near the saddle at φ = 0:
```
φ(t) ∼ exp(√α × t)    [in units where ℏ = c = 1]
```

Characteristic nucleation time: τ_nucleate ~ 1/√α ~ 1/m_σ × (1/√2)

For D6 at M_c(D6) = few × 10^2 GeV:
```
1/m_σ ~ ℏ/(m_H c²) ~ 10^-26 s
```

Nucleation is effectively instantaneous compared to the timescales of any
macroscopic measurement apparatus.

### 3. Two-sector structure is exact

The count of exactly two nontrivial sectors:

```
π₀({finite-energy configs with N ≠ 0}) = {N=+1, N=−1} = Z
```

Actually more precisely for the full configuration space:
```
π₀(M_fin.energy) = Z    [for 1+1D φ⁴: {vacuum, kink, antikink, 2-kink, ...}]
```

But for configurations near a single kink (|N| = 1 sector), there are exactly two
topological types. Multi-kink states require much more energy and are not produced
in a single measurement event.

## Open Problems

1. **Born rule from first-passage statistics.** Compute the probability distribution
   of nucleation outcomes as a function of pre-measurement field configuration and
   show P(N=+1) = |c₊|². This requires solving the stochastic φ⁴ threshold-crossing
   problem — a classical stochastic PDE problem.

2. **Multi-kink suppression.** The argument above assumes the measurement produces
   exactly one kink (|N| = 1). In principle, a strong measurement could produce a
   kink-antikink pair (N = 0) that then separates. Show that for typical measurement
   interactions, |N| = 1 is overwhelmingly more probable than |N| ≥ 2.

3. **D6-specific argument.** The two-sector structure is generic for any φ⁴ system.
   The D6-specific claim is that the relevant field at D6 depths is of φ⁴ type with
   SU(2) closure. Deriving the φ⁴ structure at D6 from deeper substrate dynamics
   (the D1/D2 mechanics) is part of the general D-depth assignment problem.

4. **Sector identification with spin quantum number.** The N = ±1 kink/antikink
   sectors must be formally identified with spin ↑/↓ (eigenvalues +ℏ/2, −ℏ/2
   of the spin operator). The Jackiw-Rebbi correspondence gives this identification
   in 1+1D. The 3+1D extension (via Skyrme topology, see `foundations/route1_skyrme.md`)
   is required for the full physical identification.
