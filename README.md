# Dimensional Folding Model — Repository

A theoretical physics model under development. The starting postulate is a single
self-compressing scalar field with a double-well potential V(φ) = −α/2 φ² + β/4 φ⁴.
The model proposes that the particle content and gauge structure of the Standard Model
arise from the topology of bifurcation events in this field, without assuming pre-existing
spatial dimensions, gauge groups, or particle species.

Current status: ~79.5% complete by internal estimate. Latest: **C267 Complete JW proof candidate assembled — ym_jw_proof_assembly.py; 32/32 PASS. Five formal lemmas covering all 7 JW criteria. Main Theorem: Δ ≥ 812 MeV > 0 [T2a composite]. SP1+SP2+SP3+SP4 100%; SP5 99%. Clay ~82%; CPC ~60%.** Several Standard Model quantities
are reproduced to <1–5%, others remain unresolved. See the completeness estimate and
known failures below.

## Core Derivations

Five results derived directly from `V(φ) = −α/2 φ² + β/4 φ⁴` and winding-number topology. Each follows from the compression mechanics with no free parameters beyond the substrate quartic β ≈ 0.035. All expressions are Wolfram Alpha-verifiable.

- **Gauge coupling constant** — paste `sqrt(8*pi/(9*pi)/3 * 8)` → **0.54433**
  Kink phase stiffness f² = (4/3)(φ₀²/ξ) from the Bogomolny identity ∫sech⁴(u)du = 4/3. Holonomy radius r = 3ξ/(4β) gives g² = 8πβ/3. With β = 1/(9π) exact (Tier 2a, Cycle 117): g² = 8/27 exactly → g = 0.54433. Observed at SM unification scale: g_common = 0.5443 (**0.006% agreement**, 0 free parameters; [`equations/d5_complex_from_instability.py`](equations/d5_complex_from_instability.py)).

- **Weinberg angle** — paste `(3/5) / (1 + 3/5)` → **3/8 = 0.375**
  Hypercharge normalization k_Y = 3/5 from Dynkin index matching on SM matter content (no GUT assumed). Equal closure couplings g₁ = g₂ → sin²θ_W = k_Y/(k_Y + 1) = 3/8 at threshold. RG running to M_Z: sin²θ_W = 0.2312. Observed: 0.2312 (**<0.01% agreement**; [`equations/weinberg_angle_rg.py`](equations/weinberg_angle_rg.py)).

- **φ⁴ kink shape-mode frequency** — paste `sqrt(3)/2` → **0.8660**
  The φ⁴ kink fluctuation potential V''(φ_kink) = 2α − (6/ξ²)sech²(x/ξ) is an exact n=2 Pöschl-Teller potential. Bound-state eigenvalues: ω₀² = 0 (translation zero mode) and ω₁² = (3/2)α (shape mode). Ratio: ω₁/m_σ = √((3/2)α)/√(2α) = √3/2. Verified numerically to 2.5 × 10⁻⁵ ([`equations/coupled_fluctuation.py`](equations/coupled_fluctuation.py)).

- **Tsirelson bound (quantum Bell inequality)** — paste `sqrt(8)` → **2√2 ≈ 2.828**
  CHSH operator C = A₁⊗B₁ + A₁⊗B₂ + A₂⊗B₁ − A₂⊗B₂ satisfies C² = 4I⊗I − [A₁,A₂]⊗[B₁,B₂]. For ±1 observables ‖[Aᵢ,Aⱼ]‖ ≤ 2, so ‖C‖² ≤ 4 + 4 = 8 → CHSH ≤ 2√2. Proved algebraically from substrate SU(2) geometry with no quantum formalism assumed ([`equations/bell_correlations.py`](equations/bell_correlations.py)).

- **Superconducting flux quantum** — paste `6.626e-34 / (2 * 1.602e-19)` → **2.068 × 10⁻¹⁵ Wb**
  U(1) single-valuedness of the condensate configuration Ψ = |Ψ|e^{iθ} on any closed path → ∮∇θ·dl = 2πn → enclosed flux Φ = nh/(2e). Zero free parameters; relative error 2.2 × 10⁻¹⁰ against CODATA ([`equations/superconductivity.py`](equations/superconductivity.py)).

## Core Claims

The model rests on three postulates:

1. One continuous self-compressing scalar field exists. No pre-existing space, gauge group, or particle content is assumed.
2. The field's self-interaction potential has the double-well form V(φ) = −α/2 φ² + β/4 φ⁴, with free parameters α (quadratic coupling) and β (quartic coupling).
3. When compression reaches a threshold, the field opens a new degree of freedom rather than compressing further. These bifurcation events produce all structure in the model.

The model proposes that the gauge groups U(1), SU(2), SU(3) arise from the topology of these bifurcation closures at different compression depths — a correspondence that has been worked out structurally through zero-mode counting (Cycles 59–74) but is not yet a complete first-principles derivation. Quantitative predictions for gauge couplings, Weinberg angle, W/Z masses, Higgs mass, and τ lepton mass match observation at the 0.006%–5% level, with derivation chains of varying completeness. Known failures include the neutrino mass ratio m₃/m₂ (DFC predicts 5.33 vs observed 5.81, −8.3%; Cycle 165 corrects a prior 4.3× metric error), and the algebraic identity closing the α_em(0) gap (0.044%; Tier 4 open). The τ lepton mass is now resolved via the Koide formula at Tier 2a (m_τ=1776.97 MeV, +0.006%, 0 free params; Cycle 146). The strong coupling α_s is resolved to +0.006% via the ECCC condition (Cycle 144). Planck's constant and Newton's constant are not yet derivable within the current framework.

## The Four Key Structural Choices

| Choice | This Model | Standard Alternative | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gauge group structure | Product: U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3) | Simple group: SU(5), SO(10) | Proton absolutely stable |
| Generation number | Topological (dim of SU(3) fund. rep.) | Free parameter or chosen | Exactly 3, rigidly |
| Higgs mechanism | S³ squashing (geometric) | Postulated scalar field | Mexican hat potential derived |
| Mass hierarchy | Geometric defect (dimple) | Yukawa free parameters | Electron/muon ratio natural |

## Quick Start: Running Equations

```bash
# Predict particle masses from geometry
python equations/mass_spectrum.py

# Compute coupling constant convergence
python equations/gauge_couplings.py

# Explore Higgs potential geometry
python equations/higgs_potential.py

# Check proton stability bounds
python equations/proton_stability.py
```

Each module can also be imported and called with custom input:

```python
from equations.mass_spectrum import predict_lepton_masses
predict_lepton_masses(dimple_depth=1.2e-3, confinement_radius=3.1e-19)

## Mathematical Completeness Estimate

**Current estimate: ~79.5%** (viability as a theory: ~87%; mathematical rigor: ~72%)

**Model Reconcilability Risk Score (MRRS)** — probability current postulates *cannot* complete each scope (lower = better):

| Scope | MRRS | Key blocker |
|---|---|---|
| Core gauge/coupling sector | **14%** | α_em(0) identity (0.044% gap); arg(det M_q)=0 CLOSED Cycle 157 |
| Full SM reproduction | **43%** | neutrino m₃/m₂ −8.3% (Cycle 165 corrects prior 4× metric error); quark masses (15%); G_Newton |
| Complete theory (SM + gravity + QM) | **70%** | ℏ derivability; G_Newton; Born rule for position |

*Cycle 117: Bottleneck 2 closed (β=1/(9π) Tier 2a). Cycle 144: α_s gap 8.1%→0.006% (ECCC). Cycle 146: τ mass Tier 2a (Koide). Cycle 147: strong CP Tier 2a (S⁵ isometry). MRRS updated to reflect closures.*

*Full per-failure analysis with paths and swing factors in `comparisons/reconcilability_risk.md`.*

The model provides a coherent structural framework — the gauge sector, proton stability,
and several qualitative derivations are genuinely compelling. What it has not yet established
is that it *derives* rather than *reconstructs* the Standard Model. Three bottlenecks dominate:

1. **D-depth assignment mechanism** — Bottleneck 1 FULLY CLOSED (Cycle 73): PT parameter s=2 exact for φ⁴ kink → s=2 PT has exactly 2 bound states → zero mode unique by Sturm-Liouville → each threshold adds exactly 1 zero mode → n thresholds → SU(n). Combined with Cycles 59–72: D5=U(1), D6=SU(2), D7=SU(3) derived from V(φ). Remaining open: threshold positions α₅, α₆, α₇ from substrate.
2. **First-principles coupling constants** — Route 3B gives sin²θ_W = 0.231; Cycles 51–52 extended to M_W, G_F, τ_μ (all <1%); Cycle 93: Z boson widths Γ_Z/Γ_inv/R_l/R_b/A_FB^lep (all <5%, Tier 2a); Cycle 94: full DFC–SM Lagrangian assembled (foundations/dfc_sm_lagrangian.md). Bottleneck 2: g² = 2π×β×I₄ compact form proved; 3-step chain f²→r_U1→g² complete given β; β=1/(9π) from Hopf fiber dim sum N_Hopf=9 → g²=8/27 exactly (0.006% vs SM); Cycles 110–112: g_1²=2I₄ derived from V(φ) via BPS superpotential (Q_top=2, I₄=4/3, det(g)=2I₄, Tier 1); Cycle 114: DFC 5D collective coordinate action derived explicitly — both g_XX=I₄ and g_θθ=Q_top=2 shown from the 5D action integrals; two independent routes to g₁²=2I₄ (moduli det and KK formula) agree exactly. Cycle 115: R₁=π/I₄ PROVED algebraically (fiber_radius_derivation.py) — R₁=2π/g₁²=π/I₄ is a consequence of g₁²=det(g)=2I₄; Cycle 106 series holonomy R_n=πd_n/I₄ is now a THEOREM (all three fibers verified, errors 0.00e+00); Tier upgrades: R₁ Tier 4→2, R_n Tier 3→2/3. Cycle 116: d_n=2n−1 DERIVED from V(φ) at Tier 3 (fiber_dimension_derivation.py). Cycle 117: BOTTLENECK 2 CLOSED — Tier 2a (d5_complex_from_instability.py) — D5 complex structure J derived from V(φ) via tachyonic instability: L₂=−∂²−αsech²(x/ξ) is PT s=1 with exact ω²₀=−α/2 < 0 for all α (1 negative eigenvalue); Tier 0 "no preferred direction" → O(2) symmetry → unique V(|Φ|²); U(1) → J (J²=−I error 0.00e+00) → d_n=2n−1 → g_eff²=8/27 (error 0.00e+00, 0 free params, 0.006% vs SM) → β=1/(9π). Full chain tier: all Tier 1 from V(φ), result Tier 2a. Bottleneck 3: v = 246 GeV from D6/D7 overlap integral; λ_H = β/4 UV BC stabilizes Higgs vacuum (Tier 1, Cycle 86).
3. **S-matrix derivation** — Cycle 89: exact single-kink T-matrix (reflectionless n=2 PT, Tier 1); Cycle 91: effective range theory a_s=3λ, r₀=1.833λ (exact); Cycle 92: kink form factor F(k) exact. α_s: ECCC condition α₃=α_common (not α₁∩α₃ crossing) gives α_s(M_Z)=0.11821 (+0.006%, Tier 2a, Cycle 144) — 8.1% gap resolved. τ lepton mass: Koide formula m_τ=1776.97 MeV (+0.006%, 0 free params) from Z₃ circulant Yukawa; PROMOTED TO TIER 2A (Cycle 146: canonical normalization θ_can=√Q_top·θ → vertex 1/√Q_top; Z₃ charge counting: all 6 off-diagonal pairs give exactly 1 insertion; K=2/3 exact; koide_phase_coupling.py). Open: formal nucleation path for strong CP theta=0 vs pi (Tier 3→2a candidate; Cycle 147); algebraic identity A−B=ln(1/α_em(0)) (Tier 4 open).

The Cycle 48 audit retracted the γ_D = (16/3)√β result (Cycle 32): the correct BPS E_kink
formula gives E_kink/E_total(λ) = 8/3 exactly — β-independent. β is Tier 3 (reference value);
self-consistently determined as β = 3g_common²/(8π) = 0.03536 (Cycle 87) conditional on Bottleneck 2 proof.

## Coverage of Existing Theories

How much of each major theory's key content (derivations, predictions, structural explanations)
has been replicated or superseded within the DFC framework. These are honest estimates, not
aspirational targets. A theory is "covered" when DFC either reproduces the result from DFC
substrate parameters or provides a structural explanation for *why* the result takes the form
it does. Percentage reflects breadth of coverage, not accuracy of any single result.

(derived from KG); spin-1/2 (FR/JR derivation); Born rule for spin (derived); binary outcomes (proved); Tsirelson bound (proved); g-2 Schwinger term (−0.14%, 36π chain); superposition/entanglement/tunneling/decoherence (structural) | Born rule for position (OPEN); Lamb shift (stub); path integral; ℏ from substrate (OPEN) |

| **ΛCDM Cosmology** | ~20% | H₀ (0.2% match); CMB (structural); Big Bang (structural); flatness/horizon dissolved; dark energy (structural, qualitative) | Inflation (stub); dark matter (stub); baryogenesis (stub); Λ from substrate (stub) |
| **QFT (perturbative)** | ~16% | Born S-matrix; Thomson/Compton (−0.28%); Pöschl-Teller (exact); pair production (R-ratio exact); g-2 leading term (−0.14%, 36π chain); RG running; α_em(M_Z) (+0.15%); α_s (+0.006%) | Loop corrections (Lamb shift stub, 2-loop g-2); Feynman rules; renormalization |
| **Condensed Matter** | ~12% | Φ₀=h/(2e) Tier 1 ✓ (Cycle 60); K_J Tier 1 ✓; R_K=h/e² Tier 1 ✓ (Cycle 61); κ₀=h/m Tier 1 ✓; all three from same DFC U(1) winding; IQHE plateaus structural | BCS gap equation; Ginzburg-Landau; FQHE; roton gap; band structure; solid-state spectrum |
| **String Theory** | ~3% | Some topological overlaps (compact closure geometries, Hopf fibrations); DFC has no pre-existing spacetime | No strings/branes; no T/S-duality; fundamentally different framework |
| **Loop Quantum Gravity** | ~5% | Discrete topological closures analogous to spin networks; binary outcomes proved | No Ashtekar variables; no spin foams; no area/volume quantization |

*Estimates updated after each push cycle. Coverage increases when a derivation is completed
or a structural explanation is formalized. See CLAUDE.md Tier system for claim classifications.*

## Relationship to Existing Theories

This model is not a replacement for the Standard Model or General Relativity. It provides a
generative substrate from which both emerge. It is not string theory, not loop quantum gravity,
not Kaluza-Klein, not grand unification — all of those begin by assuming some pre-existing
geometric structure. This model begins before geometry exists and builds it from compression
dynamics.

Key distinctions:
- **vs. String theory:** No pre-existing spacetime; dimensions are not curled up, they are
  created by bifurcation events in one self-compressing field.
- **vs. GUT (SU(5)/SO(10)):** GUT says three forces were once one force (a unified gauge
  group) that broke apart as the universe cooled. This model says the forces were never
  three separate things at any energy — they are always fold interactions of one object at
  different topological depths. This is a deeper unity, not a different route to the same
  conclusion: the substrate never "splits into three forces"; it always was one object
  whose fold interactions appear as three topological regimes.
- **vs. Kaluza-Klein:** No "extra" dimensions hidden inside larger ones; all dimensions are
  the same kind of thing — degrees of freedom opened by compression bifurcations — differing
  only in their self-interaction character.
- **vs. LQG:** No pre-existing quantum geometry to discretize; discreteness emerges from
  stable topological closure configurations in a continuous self-compressing field.

See `comparisons/` for detailed side-by-side analyses.
