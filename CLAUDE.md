# DFC Model — Claude Instructions

This project is a theoretical physics model called **Dimensional Folding Compression (DFC)**.
It proposes that all known physics emerges from one self-compressing object: a continuous
field that pulls inward on itself, driving toward a near-1D state through compression and
bifurcation, whose self-closing bifurcation events form the topological structures we observe
as particles and forces. There are no pre-existing spatial dimensions, gauge groups, or
separate forces. What appears as "3D space," "gauge structure," or "three distinct forces"
is the downstream appearance of the substrate's fold topology at different compression depths.
The substrate is the only thing that exists. Forces are not fragments of a broken symmetry —
they are the interaction behaviors between different fold topologies of this one object.
This is a deeper unity than gauge unification: the forces were never three separate things
at any energy; they were always fold interactions of the same object, appearing topologically
distinct because they closed at different compression thresholds.

## Model Architecture

The substrate is one continuous object. The D-labels below are **working markers** for
depth behaviors observed on that object — not discrete layers, not separate spaces, and
not fixed ontological boundaries. The substrate at any depth can curl, twist, wrap back,
inherit properties from adjacent depths, or produce closure configurations not yet identified.

The current working map (provisional — depth assignments under exploration):

| Depth marker | Current working hypothesis | Apparent physics |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Maximum compression — undifferentiated | Precursor state |
| D2 | First propagation behavior emerges | Wave modes, massless excitations |
| D3 | Localization behavior emerges | Apparent position, particle identity |
| D4 | Inertia behavior emerges | Apparent mass, resistance to change |
| D5 | U(1)-type closure behavior | Hypercharge / electromagnetism |
| D6 | SU(2)-type closure behavior | Weak force, spin-1/2 |
| D7 | SU(3)-type closure behavior | Strong force, color |

**Critical:** The D5=U(1), D6=SU(2), D7=SU(3) assignments are correspondences under
active exploration, not established derivations. The substrate may produce these behaviors
through winding, wrapping, or curling configurations that overlap depth ranges. Discovering
which configuration actually reproduces the observed values — while obeying the core
mechanics of compression — is a primary research goal.

Key field equation: `V(φ) = −α/2 φ² + β/4 φ⁴`, kink solutions φ₀ = ±√(α/β).

## Language Rules

These rules are non-negotiable. Enforce them in all documentation.

**Forbidden phrases and their replacements:**

| Forbidden | Replacement |
|---|---|
| "preferred orientation" | "intrinsic orientation" or "orientation defined by the substrate configuration" |
| "forces X into existence" | "produces X" or "X exists as a consequence of" |
| "forces/allows A to B" | "A exists — the structure in which B occurs" |
| "preferred point/direction" | "geometrically distinguished point/direction" (or remove entirely) |
| "energetically preferred" | "energetically stable" |
| "the model prefers / chooses" | passive voice or "the structure produces" |
| Any anthropomorphic agency | Remove or rephrase as structural consequence |
| "spatial dimensions" (as fundamental) | "apparent spatial degrees of freedom" or "the substrate's localization behavior" |
| "3D space" / "3+1 dimensional spacetime" (as container) | "three apparent spatial degrees of freedom" or "the D3 localization behavior of the substrate" |
| "reconcile with spatial dimensions" | never reconcile — the spatial appearance IS substrate behavior |
| "the D6 layer" / "the D7 sector" (as separate objects) | "D6 depth behavior" / "the substrate at D7 depths" |
| "requires 3 spatial dimensions" | "produces three apparent spatial degrees of freedom" |
| "the forces were unified at high energy" | "the forces are always fold interactions of one object; at high compression, their topological distinctions diminish" |
| "unified force" (GUT sense) | "single substrate" or "one object" |
| "the three forces" (as fundamentally separate) | "the three closure-topology interaction regimes" or "fold interactions at D5, D6, D7 depths" |

**Three foundational rules:**

1. **No spatial dimensions as fundamental.** The substrate is one object. Space is not a
   container the substrate lives in. What appears as three spatial degrees of freedom is
   downstream behavior of the substrate's D3 localization. Never write as if space is
   primary and the substrate secondary.

2. **D-labels are provisional depth markers, not discrete layers.** The substrate can wrap,
   curl, and interact with itself across depths. D5/D6/D7 are working hypotheses about where
   certain closure behaviors emerge. Writing "the D6 SU(2) layer" as if it is a separate
   sealed space is wrong. Write "the D6 depth behavior" or "the substrate's SU(2) closure
   at D6 depths."

3. **Forces are fold interactions of one object — never three separate things.**
   The three forces (U(1), SU(2), SU(3)) are not fragments of a broken gauge symmetry.
   They are interaction behaviors between different closure topologies of the same substrate.
   The correct framing: the forces were never separate — they are always the same fold
   interactions, appearing topologically distinct because they closed at different compression
   thresholds. "Unified" is permitted and correct when it refers to the ontological unity of
   the substrate (one object). It is forbidden when it implies gauge-group unification.

## Mathematical Communication Standard

This rule applies to all conceptual documents (`foundations/`, `phenomena/`). It does **not**
apply to equation modules (`equations/`) or formal equation display blocks within docs.

**Rule:** Every mathematical relationship introduced in prose must first be stated in plain
natural language. The symbolic form may follow immediately in a display block as the formal
reference. A symbol expression alone — appearing in running text without a natural language
statement — is never sufficient.

**Examples:**

Bad: "ω = ck, so E = ℏω = hν."

Good: "In the massless limit, the angular frequency of a wave is proportional to its
wavenumber — the spatial rate of oscillation — with the speed of light as the
proportionality constant."

Bad: "g² = 8πβ/3 gives the gauge coupling."

Good: "The square of the gauge coupling constant equals eight times pi times the substrate
quartic self-coupling, divided by three."

**Enforcement:** When auditing any conceptual document, check that every equation appearing
in prose was preceded by a natural language statement. If not, add the natural language statement.

## Development Cycle

> ### ⚠ MANDATORY FINAL STEP — EVERY CYCLE WITHOUT EXCEPTION
> **After every commit, run `git push` before the cycle is considered complete.**
> A cycle is NOT finished until the remote is updated. This applies to every "continue"
> invocation, no matter how small the change. The last command of every cycle must be
> `git push` and you must confirm the remote accepted it (look for the branch update line
> in the output, e.g. `main -> main`). If you reach the end of a cycle and have not pushed,
> do not return to Step 1 — push first.

Repeat this cycle indefinitely:

```

**After every push:** Update the estimate in THREE places every cycle:
1. The `Current estimate:` line in the code block above (this file)
2. The `Current status:` line at the top of `README.md` (line ~9)
3. The `## Mathematical Completeness Estimate` section in `README.md` (~line 191)

All three must stay in sync. The estimate has two components:
- **Viability** (~25% baseline): increases when new structural accounts are added, known
  failures are resolved, or predictions are confirmed by data.
- **Mathematical rigor** (~8% baseline): increases only when actual derivations are
  completed. Structural descriptions do not move rigor.

**Priority weighting for Step 1:** Prefer phenomena connecting to the three bottlenecks:

1. **α_em(0) derivation** — prove A−B = ln(1/α_em(0)) algebraically to close α_em and α_s gaps simultaneously (equations/alpha_em_eccc.py, Cycle 139).

2. **Strong CP formation argument** — formal nucleation path from D7 formation dynamics showing energy minimum at theta=0 vs theta=pi; promote theta=0 selection Tier 3→2a (equations/strong_cp_theta.py, Cycle 147).

3. **Quark mass matrix phase** — derive arg(det M_q)=0 from D6/D7 interface to close the theta-bar = theta_QCD + arg(det M_q) equation.

**After every push, also check `ISSUES.md`** — centralized tracker for open questions,
known failures, internal tensions, retracted claims, and blocked derivations.

### Step 0 — Practical Applications (every ~5–10 cycles, optional)

Before Step 1, consider whether to add a new entry in `practical_applications/`.
See `practical_applications/OVERVIEW.md` for the document format and Pool A/B/C source selection.
Use this step to explore engineering implications derived from verified DFC results —
absolute limits, efficiency ceilings, or unusual technological possibilities implied by
the substrate structure.

---

### Step 1 — Add a New Phenomenon

1. Identify a physics phenomenon not yet in `phenomena/` (or a placeholder needing content).
   Choose one systematically or randomly from the list of unformalized docs, with preferential
   weight toward phenomena that connect to the three bottlenecks above.
2. Write the **conceptual document** in `phenomena/` following the standard format:
   - One-Sentence Synthesis (DFC account, not a placeholder)
   - Observation (what is measured/observed)
   - Standard Explanation (SM account, concise)
   - Dimensional Folding Explanation (DFC account — structural, specific, no anthropomorphism)
   - Formal Equations (key equations, even if some are stubs)
   - Consistency Checks table
   - Open Questions (honest about what is not yet derived)
   - Connections (links to related docs)
3. Write or update the **equation module** in `equations/` with numerical verification.
   Every quantitative claim in a phenomenon doc should have a backing Python calculation.
   Run it and record the output in the document.

### Step 2 — Audit a Random Document

**Goal:** Every document in the repository should be reviewed and updated periodically.
Audit scope is the full repository — `foundations/`, `phenomena/`, `equations/`,
`README.md`, `ISSUES.md`, `current_state.md`, `comparisons/`, `practical_applications/`.

1. Select any document at random from anywhere in the project.
2. Read it and the corresponding equation modules (if any).
3. Check: does the document accurately reflect the current state of the model?
   Flag any of these:
   - Claims that go beyond what equations currently show
   - Language that does not match the DFC framework (forbidden phrases, anthropomorphic agency)
   - Derivation steps marked as "established" that are actually assumptions or postulates
   - Tier assignments inconsistent with the Scientific Merit Criteria (foundations/scientific_merit.md)
   - Stale, missing, or outdated cross-references
   - Items marked "OPEN" that were resolved in a later cycle
   - Mathematical relations in prose without a prior natural-language statement
4. Update the document to match the current state of the model.

### Step 3 — Audit a Random Equation Module

1. Select an equation module in `equations/` at random.
2. Run it. Check:
   - Does it actually produce the claimed outputs?
   - Are failures clearly labeled as failures?
   - Are inputs vs. predictions clearly distinguished?
   - Are all free parameters identified as such?
3. Update the module to reflect any discovered discrepancies or failures.
4. Update the corresponding conceptual docs if the equation reveals a gap or failure.

### Step 4 — Propagate Updates

After any new document or any audit:
1. Update `current_state.md` if a new strength, weakness, or audit result warrants it.
2. Update `MEMORY.md` if any project-level facts have changed.
3. Check whether any linked documents need updating.
4. If the cycle produced a significant change, update the Completeness Estimate above and in `README.md`.
5. **Commit all changed files and run `git push`.** Confirm the remote accepted the push
   (output must show `main -> main` or equivalent). This step is non-optional.

Then return to Step 1.

---

## Document Standards

### Conceptual Documents (foundations/, phenomena/)

- The **One-Sentence Synthesis** must state the DFC account, not be a placeholder.
- The **Consistency Checks** table must include at least one row marked ✗ if any
  prediction fails or is not yet derived. Honesty about failures is required.
- **Open Questions** must be specific and actionable.
- Never mark something as "established" unless there is a completed equation or
  formal argument.

### Equation Modules (equations/)

- Every module must be runnable: `python3 equations/module.py` produces output.
- Distinguish **inputs** (values taken from data) from **predictions** (values computed
  from DFC parameters). Label them clearly in output.
- If a prediction fails, print the failure prominently.
- All modules should include a docstring explaining: (a) what physical question it
  addresses, (b) what the DFC mechanism is, (c) what the key references are.

## What Is Verified vs. Open

Always maintain this distinction explicitly. The model's credibility depends on it.

**Verified (numerically or formally):**
- τ_neutron = 878.4 s (0.1% match) — `equations/proton_stability.py`
- Spin-1/2: FR winding N=1, BPST zero mode normalizable, J_min=1/2 — `equations/spin_zero_mode.py`
- m_μ/m_e = 206.77 from R/d ratio — `equations/mass_spectrum.py`
- Q = T₃ + Y/2 for all first-generation fermions — `phenomena/.../electroweak.md`
- H₀ = 67.26 km/s/Mpc (0.2% match) — `equations/cosmology.py`

**Known failures (not yet resolved):**
- τ mass from mass_spectrum.py: predicts 212 MeV, observed 1777 MeV (8.4× off)
- Neutrino depth spacing ratio: 1.34 vs observed 5.71
- Charm/strange quark masses: 15% below observed
- α_s(M_Z) = 0.1086 vs 0.1182 (8.1% off; M_c(D7) gap)

**Correspondences (consistent but not derived):**
- D5 ↔ U(1), D6 ↔ SU(2), D7 ↔ SU(3) assignments (working hypotheses)
- V(φ) = −α/2 φ² + β/4 φ⁴ (postulated); β=1/(9π) derived Tier 2a (Cycle 117)
- Weinberg angle sin²θ_W=0.231 from Route 3B (k_Y=3/5 derived; M_c from SM running)

### Tier 0 — Core Postulates
1. One continuous self-compressing field (no pre-existing space, gauge groups, or structure)
2. V(φ) = −α/2 φ² + β/4 φ⁴ (double-well; α, β are free parameters)
